            <p class="">
                "Men Do Cry" is a concept that aims to 
                gauge the emotional aptitude of men, 
                primarily ones of color. The inception 
                of "Men Do Cry" derives from a 
                conversation held between its creator, 
                Maya Chisem, and a friend. 
                The exchange between them left Maya 
                wondering- are men dealing with their 
                emotions? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Collaborating with videographer extraordinaire, Louis Halley, the duo of Maya and Louis will present you with the scintillating visual journey that will become "Men Do Cry".

            selected locations enhance the mood and 
            emotion of her images, creating a truly 
            memorable and personal experience for her 
            clients and appreciator of her photos alike.
